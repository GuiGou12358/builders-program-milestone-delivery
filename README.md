## :mailbox: Milestone Delivery Process

The milestone delivery process is part of a running [Phala Builders Program](https://docs.phala.network/developers/phat-contract/builders-program) grant.

:warning: Before you submit a milestone, make sure it complies with our [Guidelines for Milestone Deliverables](./support/milestone-deliverables-guidelines.md).

1. **Milestone Delivery:**
    1. [Fork](https://github.com/Phala-Network/builders-program-milestone-delivery/fork) this repository with the **same GitHub account** that you used to submit the application.
    2. In the newly created fork, create a new folder with your `project_name` and a copy of the milestone delivery template ([`deliveries/project_name/milestone-delivery-template.md`](deliveries/project_name/milestone-delivery-template.md)). If you're using the GitHub web interface, you will need to create a new folder and file then copy the contents of the template inside the new one. Make sure you **do not modify the template folder and file directly**.
    3. Fill out the template with the details of your milestone, including all deliverables as listed in your application.
    4. Name the file `project_name-milestone-number.md`.
    5. Create a pull request and fill out the comment template.
2. **Milestone Review:**
    1. Evaluators can issue comments and request changes on the pull request. Their feedback needs to be resolved before your milestone is accepted.
    2. Milestone Evaluators will merge your pull request to accept the delivery.
3. **Milestone Payment:**
    1. Upon milestone acceptance, the Phala operations team will begin to process payment. Payments are usually processed within 14 days.
    2. Payment is made to the Phala address specified in the initial application. The exchange rate for PHA depends on the time of payment.
